[h1]Galatic Factions[/h1]

Galactic Factions is about creating interesting decisions regarding factions both within and without your empire. Choose which factions have a say in your government and force your ethics into other empires through the Galactic Community.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*] Create multi-ethic factions that have the demands of all sub ethics.
[*] Replace default factions with a faction that matches your ethics exactly. 
[*] Move pops whose ethics don't match your ethics into disenfranchised factions that are always unhappy.
[*] Create edicts to spawn factions that mix disenfranchised ethics with your empire's ethics to bring unhappy disenfranchised pops into government.
[*] Add resolutions in the Galactic Community that force factions into other empires.
[/list]

[h2]Features I'm Considering[/h2]
[list]
[*] Xenophobes are better able resist foreign factions.
[*] Factions or the ideologies they represent have an existence outside the direct influence of empires, like crises.
[*] Add resolutions to determine how galactic factions are treated, such as it being illegal to suppress galactic factions.

[h3]Notes[/h3]

Thank you for trying out Galatic Factions. Please leave comments about balance or bugs. Of particular interest to me are statements like "what's the point of X?".

[*] Leaving and rejoining the galactic community should toggle galactic factions appropriately
